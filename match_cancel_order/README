The other day, I checked the daily production capacity data and found that some data had been canceled due to incorrect entry. This resulted in a negative production quantity. The issue is that there was no indication of the original data that was canceled.

To address this, my proposed solution is:

Identify products with the same Product Order.
Identify products with the same production quantity.
Map the IDs that are likely canceled based on the assumption that 'orders are always canceled before placing a new order with the same quantity.
